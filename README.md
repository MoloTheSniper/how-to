My Employee Tree Program

<h1>Project Overview</h1>
Employee Tree is a program that lets employees manage their schedules and employees with positions of power can manage the schedules of other employees that report to them.

The employees manage their schedules by creating new ones, deleting and updating existing schedules. The CEO has a special privilege in that he/she can manage the schedules of employees that dont report to him/her directly.

Here are the languages i used to write this software:

<ul>
  <li>PHP (backend / server side)</li>
  <li>HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap (Frontend / Client Side)</li>
  <li>SQL (database)</li>
</ul>

<h3> Why PHP?</h3>
It doesnt require users to constantly update libraries when a new version is released, which means people who download this code today will still be able to install the program and have no issues in the future.

It is fast and secure. It provides in built fuctions such as hashing for passwords and it also gives in built functions to dehash passwords which saves time for the programmer.

It offers sessions. This makes it easy to use an ID of a user across an entire website without manually managing IDs

Lastly, I had only 8 days after my exams to build this project and PHP is the language i was taught this year interms of a fullstack programming thus, it was easier for me to work with, given the short time i had to build this program :)
